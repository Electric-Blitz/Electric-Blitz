<p align=center><b><i>Java Projects</i></b></p>
&emsp;Towards the beginning years of college, I took a class on the programming language Java.
Originally, the files now here on GitHub were the assignments that I have since adjusted to be
used outside of the original format and IDE.
<br><br>
&emsp;Aside from the format and omitting notes that referenced teachers and specific courses,
these are unaltered. What I want to do is take these assignments and rewrite them to demonstrate
what I have learned overall from my time in personal projects and other college courses. As I
complete those, I will put them up on my GitHub account in the near future. More than anything,
it is simply practice for myself.

<p align=center><b><i>Neural Network Project</i></b></p>
&emsp;One course I had taken during college that was unique from any other was a course titled
Neural Nets. While I do not currently have the work from that course on this GitHub, my final
project that I worked on with a team is currently available on GitHub.

&emsp;The repository has been cloned from a still existing GitHub that was created by the professor
of that course. The cloned repository can be found here: https://github.com/ZachAKent/s22-team2-project

&emsp;The project's purpose was to teach the network to recognize the image of a trading card and
determine what card it is by comparing the taken image with a catelogged array of every released
trading card that had been released at the time of the neural network's creation.

&emsp;More details can be found in this project's README, including the steps to install and
observe the results of the demo.
