<p align=center><b><i>Java Projects</i></b></p>
&emsp;Towards the beginning years of college, I took a class on the programming language Java.
Originally, the files now here on GitHub were the assignments that I have since adjusted to be
used outside of the original format and IDE.
<br><br>
&emsp;Aside from the format and omitting notes that referenced teachers and specific courses,
these are unaltered. What I want to do is take these assignments and rewrite them to better match
what I have learned from my time in personal projects and other college courses. Those will also
be available on my GitHub account in the near future.
