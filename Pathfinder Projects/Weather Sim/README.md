<p align=center><b><i>Pathfinder Weather Simulator</i></b></p>

This project simulates weather as through the system of Pathfinder, rolling all the dice and using the predetermined tables given from the Ultimate Wilderness
book for temperature, wind speed, cloud cover, precipitation, etc.<br>

It is not completed yet, but so far it simulates seasons and temperature. This will be updated once precipitation is completed.<br>

There are also plans to remake this as a html/CSS/Javascript page, but that's later on. I first want to get the calculations right in C++ as practice.
