<p align=center><b><i>Why hello there!</i></b></p>
This GitHub is made for storing any personal projects I may have that I am fine with making open source. There are several projects that I have worked on during my education at Middle Tennessee State University ranging from assignments given during courses as well as personal projects.<br>
<br>
While I do not intend on putting any class assignments out onto public, I will gladly put any personal projects I do on here to show what I have done from multiple given languages. There is one larger project that I would classify mroe as personal than a school project, however, I had begun that project during an MTSU hackathon with two other individuals. As I do not want to share code that they had made without express permission, I will not be making that project open source. I may at points post updates or concepts of code that I have done on here instead.<br>
<br>
This account is more acting as a personal file of work I have done. If you are interested in anything that may appear here, by all means feel free to use it or alter it as you please! I hope it's of some use to anyone!<br><br>
