<p align=center><b><i>Hello there!</i></b></p>
&emsp;Welcome to my GitHub profile. Here, I store personal projects that I’m comfortable making open source. You’ll find work ranging from my time as a student at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) up to the present.<br>
<br>
&emsp;Some of these projects are archived from my college days to showcase what I’ve done in the past, but please note that I don’t condone using these projects without giving proper credit.<br>
<br>
&emsp;That said, if anything here helps to solve a problem you may have had or helps to come up with an idea, I’m glad I could be of help! Have a great day!<br>
<br>
