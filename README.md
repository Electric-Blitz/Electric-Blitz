<p align=center><b><i>Hello there!</i></b></p>
&emsp;This GitHub is made for storing any personal projects I may have that I am fine with making open source. These projects range in date from my time in college at Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU) to the present.<br>
<br>
&emsp;Any college assignments that are uploaded onto this page are meant to be stored in one place for my own use or to demonstrate what I have worked on in the past. I do not condone the use of my past assignments without credit, and I certainly do not condone the use of my previous assignments to be used in place of one's work. All class assignments I have done and turned in will be kept in a singular folder to differentiate them from personal projects.<br>
<br>
&emsp;That said, if anything in my projects helps someone solve an issue that they are having or gives them an idea for an alternative solution without outright using the work, then I am glad that my work was of use!<br>
