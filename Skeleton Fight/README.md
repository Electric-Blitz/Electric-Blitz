<h1>Overview</h1><br>
Over the summer in 2022, I wanted to build a simple game in C++ to refamiliarize myself with the language after<br>
so many of my college courses had me use other languages. The game itself was simple; a basic battle system<br>
where you pick between three different sets of stats and then fight skeletons that will only attack as they<br>
get progressively stronger.<br><br>

After defeating a skeleton, you choose one of the three stats to increase to "level up" for the next skeleton.<br>
You may attack, heal your character 5 hit points, or defend which raises your defense for multiple turns.<br><br>

The game is fully functional and makes full use of classes for both the player and the skeletons. It takes in commands<br>
from the user and is not case-sensitive, and it can be used in both LINUX & Windows without issue. I was not able to<br>
get it to work on Apple though, unfortunately.<br><br>

The game works, it's just very basic. So, after finishing a draft of it, I decided to transfer the idea onto the<br>
Unity Game Engine and had since continued the work from there. Doing so let me practice with C#, add visuals, and<br>
making it generally more like what people would consider a game than it was before.<br><br>

In this file is the C++ version. I revisited it and applied comments so that it is easier to follow<br>
for anyone that may be interested.
