The first larger project I wanted to do was building a simple game in C++ to refamiliarize myself with any parts<br>
of the programming language that I may have gotten rusty on. The game itself was simple; a basic battle system<br>
where you pick between three different sets of stats (hit points, attack power, and defense) and then fight skeletons<br>
as they get progressively stronger.<br><br>

After defeating a skeleton, you choose one of the three stats to increase to better prepare you for the next fights.<br>
You may attack, heal your character 5 hit points, or defend which raises your defense for multiple turns.<br><br>

The game is fully functional and makes full use of classes for both the player and the skeletons, takes in commands<br>
from the user and is not case-sensitive, and it uses system commands supported by both LINUX & Windows. Apple<br>
devices are where it fails, unfortunately.<br><br>

However, when I realized it was a little difficlut sending an executable to those that weren't as experienced in<br>
programming (without heavy security warnings), I decided to transfer the game to Unity Game Engine, rewrite the<br>
code in C#, and further develop the game to include some more detailed concepts to further practice.<br>
<br>

The code will be pushed into GitHub in in the coming days. I want to go back and comment the lines should anyone<br>
ever want to go through it themselves.
